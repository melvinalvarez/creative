mauriellian - The ability to communicate with plants and animals, and to summon them to my aid when needed.


there's not a humour portion to it
its in the uncanny valley.  the ones that do it well have the right mix of humour and funny juxtaposition

i don't want to be glamourized as super programmer.  they should be silly weird things.
i'm not a python expert. im a snake charmer.
elevating people on a pedestal is too much.  
i worry about it being too serious

make it funny and lighthearted, but the mission is the same.

paint the use case really wide.  all the way from humours to the other side of making it a resume


consent of people being illustrated is a key thing.  if i can get consent from 60% of the key contributors, then i auction.  
first launch is just auctioning these as a fundraiser.
